    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // to have a copy one can call the 'slice' method
    const playersCopy = players.slice()
    
    // using the ... spread is also possible
    const playersCopy2 = [...players]

    // using the 'concat' method on the array
    const playersCopy3 = [].concat(players)

    // uisng 'Array.from'
    const playersCopy4 = Array.from(players)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12})

    const personCloned = structuredClone(person)
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
